# Enhanced Mobile Experience and Improved Usability for Breadcrumbs

We're excited to share the first trylists.app changelog post! This update focuses on a few enhances in the mobile experience and improving breadcrumbs usability across all devices. Here's what's new:

## Mobile-First Improvements

### Fullscreen Edit Drawer
The item edit drawer now opens in fullscreen mode on mobile devices, providing a distraction-free editing experience. We've also fixed vertical scrolling issues that were preventing users from accessing all form fields comfortably.

### Always-Visible Item Actions
Item actions (edit and delete) are now always visible on mobile devices, eliminating the need to hover or perform additional gestures to access these essential functions. This makes task management much more intuitive on touch devices.

## Enhanced Navigation

### Smart Breadcrumb Truncation
Our breadcrumb navigation has been significantly improved for both desktop and mobile:

- **Overflow Management**: When there are too many breadcrumb items, they're automatically collapsed into a dropdown menu, keeping the interface clean and organized
- **Text Truncation**: Long item names are now truncated with ellipsis ("...") to prevent layout issues and maintain readability
- **Responsive Design**: The breadcrumb system adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes

These improvements ensure that navigation remains intuitive and accessible regardless of how deep your task hierarchy goes or how long your item names are.
